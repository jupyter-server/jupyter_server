  Record actions on files via the ContentsManager REST API.

  The notebook ContentsManager REST API is used by all frontends to retreive,
  save, list, delete and perform other actions on notebooks, directories,
  and other files through the UI. This is pluggable - the default acts on
  the file system, but can be replaced with a different ContentsManager
  implementation - to work on S3, Postgres, other object stores, etc.
  The events get recorded regardless of the ContentsManager implementation
  being used.

  Limitations:

  1. This does not record all filesystem access, just the ones that happen
     explicitly via the notebook server's REST API. Users can (and often do)
     trivially access the filesystem in many other ways (such as `open()` calls
     in their code), so this is usually never a complete record.
  2. As with all events recorded by the notebook server, users most likely
     have the ability to modify the code of the notebook server. Unless other
     security measures are in place, these events should be treated as user
     controlled and not used in high security areas.
  3. Events are only recorded when an action succeeds.

      This is a required field.

      Possible values:

      1. get
         Get contents of a particular file, or list contents of a directory.

      2. create
         Create a new directory or file at 'path'. Currently, name of the
         file or directory is auto generated by the ContentsManager implementation.

      3. save
         Save a file at path with contents from the client

      4. upload
         Upload a file at given path with contents from the client

      5. rename
         Rename a file or directory from value in source_path to
         value in path.

      5. copy
         Copy a file or directory from value in source_path to
         value in path.

      6. delete
