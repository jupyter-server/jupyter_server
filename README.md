The Jupyter Server provides the backend for Jupyter web applications such as
the Jupyter notebook and JupyterLab.

**jupyter_server is an early developer preview, and is not suitable for general
usage yet. Features and implementation are subject to change. Please use the
stable [notebook server](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook) for production
usecases.**
