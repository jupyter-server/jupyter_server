The Jupyter Server provides the backend for Jupyter web applications such as
the Jupyter notebook and JupyterLab.

**jupyter_server is an early developer preview, and is not suitable for general
usage yet. Features and implementation are subject to change. Please use the
stable [notebook server](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook) for production
usecases.**

Read more on the Jupyter Server [roadmap](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/issues/127).

## Installation

You can find the installation documentation for the
[Jupyter platform, on ReadTheDocs](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).
The documentation for advanced usage of Jupyter notebook can be found
[here](https://jupyter-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

To install the latest release locally, make sure you have
[pip installed](https://pip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installing/) and run:

    $ pip install jupyter_server

If Jupyter Server is a dependency of your project/application, it is important that you pin it to a version that works for your application. Currently, Jupyter Server only has minor releases and patch releases. Minor release may include API-breaking changes while patch release will never break API.

* [0.2.x](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/tree/0.2.x): Extension Application API added.
* [0.3.x](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/tree/master) (master): Kernels API changed. Kernel Providers are the new way to interface with kernels.

To install the latest patch release of a given version:

    $ pip intall jupyter_server>=0.2
