Launching a bare Jupyter Server
===============================

Most of the time, you won't need to start the Jupyter Server directly. Jupyter
Web Applications (like Jupyter Notebook, Jupyterlab, Voila, etc.) come with
their own entry points that start a server automatically.

Sometimes, though, it can be useful to start Jupyter Server directly when you
want to run multiple Jupyter Web applications at the same time. For more
details, see the  :ref:`Managing multiple extensions <managing-multiple-extensions>` page.
If these extensions are enabled, you can simple run the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    > jupyter server
