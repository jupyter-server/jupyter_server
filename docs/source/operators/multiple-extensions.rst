Managing multiple extensions
----------------------------

One of the major benefits of Jupyter Server is that you can run serve multiple
Jupyter frontend applications above the same Tornado web server.
That's because every Jupyter frontend application is now a server extension.
When you run a Jupyter Server with multiple extensions enabled, each extension
appends its own set of handlers and static assets to the server.

Listing extensions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you install a Jupyter Server extension, it *should* automatically add itself to your list of enabled extensions. You can see a list of installed extensions by calling:

.. code-block:: console

    > jupyter server extension list

    config dir: /Users/username/etc/jupyter
        myextension enabled
        - Validating myextension...
          myextension  OK

Enabling/disabling extensions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You enable/disable an extension using the following commands:

.. code-block:: console

    > jupyter server extension enable myextension

    Enabling: myextension
        - Validating myextension...
          myextension  OK
        - Extension successfully enabled.


    > jupyter server extension disable myextension

    Disabling: jupyter_home
        - Validating jupyter_home...
          jupyter_home  OK
        - Extension successfully disabled.


Running an extensions from its entrypoint
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Extensions that are also Jupyter applications (i.e. Notebook, JupyterLab, Voila, etc.) can be launched
from a CLI entrypoint. For example, launch Jupyter Notebook using:

.. code-block:: console

    > jupyter notebook


Jupyter Server will automatically start a server and the browser will be routed to Jupyter Notebook's default URL (typically, ``/tree``).

Other enabled extension will still be available to the user. The entrypoint simply offers a more direct (backwards compatible) launching mechanism.

Launching a server with multiple extensions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If multiple extensions are enabled, a Jupyter Server can be launched directly:

.. code-block:: console

    > jupyter server

        To access the server, open this file in a browser:
            file:///Users/username/pathjpserver-####-open.html
        Or copy and paste one of these URLs:
            http://localhost:8888/?token=<...>
        or http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=<...>


Extensions can also be enabled manually from the Jupyter Server entrypoint using the ``jpserver_extensions`` trait:

.. code-block:: console

    > jupyter server --ServerApp.jpserver_extensions="myextension=True"
