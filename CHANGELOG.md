## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Adopt Jupyter Kernel Management and Jupyter Protocol for kernel management framework per [JEP #45](https://github.com/jupyter/enhancement-proposals/pull/45) ([#112](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/pull/112)).

## [0.2.1] - 2020-1-10

### Added

- **pytest-plugin** for Jupyter Server.
    - Allows one to write async/await syntax in tests functions.
    - Some particularly useful fixtures include:
        - `serverapp`: a default ServerApp instance that handles setup+teardown.
        - `configurable_serverapp`: a function that returns a ServerApp instance.
        - `fetch`: an awaitable function that tests makes requests to the server API
        - `create_notebook`: a function that writes a notebook to a given temporary file path.

## [0.2.0] - 2019-12-19

### Added
- `extension` submodule ([#48](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/pull/48))
    - ExtensionApp - configurable JupyterApp-subclass for server extensions
        - Most useful for Jupyter frontends, like Notebook, JupyterLab, nteract, voila etc.
        - Launch with entrypoints
        - Configure from file or CLI
        - Add custom templates, static assets, handlers, etc.
        - Static assets are served behind a `/static/<extension_name>` endpoint.
        - Run server extensions in "standalone mode" ([#70](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/pull/70) and [#76](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/pull/76))
    - ExtensionHandler - tornado handlers for extensions.
        - Finds static assets at `/static/<extension_name>`

### Changed
- `jupyter serverextension <command>` entrypoint has been changed to `jupyter server extension <command>`.
- `toggle_jupyter_server` and `validate_jupyter_server` function no longer take a Logger object as an argument.
- Changed testing framework from nosetests to pytest ([#152](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/pull/152))
    - Depend on pytest-tornasync extension for handling tornado/asyncio eventloop
    - Depend on pytest-console-scripts for testing CLI entrypoints
- Added Github actions as a testing framework along side Travis and Azure ([#146](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/pull/146))

### Removed
- Removed the option to update `root_dir` trait in FileContentsManager and MappingKernelManager in ServerApp ([#135](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/pull/135))
