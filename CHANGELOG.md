- Added a basic, styled `login.html` template. ([220](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/pull/220), [295](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/pull/295))
- Added new extension manager API for handling server extensions. ([248](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/pull/248), [265](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/pull/265), [275](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/pull/275), [303](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/pull/303))
- The favicon and Jupyter logo are now available under jupyter_server's static namespace. ([284](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/pull/284))

### Changed.

- `load_jupyter_server_extension` should be renamed to `_load_jupyter_server_extension` in server extensions. Server now throws a warning when the old name is used. ([213](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/pull/213))
- Docs for server extensions now recommend using `authenticated` decorator for handlers. ([219](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/pull/219))
- `_load_jupyter_server_paths` should be renamed to `_load_jupyter_server_points` in server extensions. ([277](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/pull/277))
- `static_url_prefix` in ExtensionApps is now a configurable trait. ([289](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/pull/289))
- `extension_name` trait was removed in favor of `name`. ([232](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/pull/232))
- Dropped support for Python 3.5. ([296](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/pull/296))
- Made the `config_dir_name` trait configurable in `ConfigManager`. ([297](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/pull/297))

### Removed for now removed features.

- Removed ipykernel as a dependency of jupyter_server. ([255](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/pull/255))

### Fixed for any bug fixes.

- Prevent a re-definition of prometheus metrics if `notebook` package already imports them. ([#210](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/pull/210))
- Fixed `terminals` REST API unit tests that weren't shutting down properly. ([221](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/pull/221))
- Fixed jupyter_server on Windows for Python < 3.7. Added patch to handle subprocess cleanup. ([240](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/pull/240))
- `base_url` was being duplicated when getting a url path from the `ServerApp`. ([280](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/pull/280))
- Extension URLs are now properly prefixed with `base_url`. Previously, all `static` paths were not. ([285](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/pull/285))
- Changed ExtensionApp mixin to inherit from `HasTraits`. This broke in traitlets 5.0 ([294](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/pull/294))
- Replaces `urlparse` with `url_path_join` to prevent URL squashing issues. ([304](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/pull/304))

## [0.3] - 2020-4-22

### Added

- ([#191](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/pull/191)) Async kernel managment is now possible using the `AsyncKernelManager` from `jupyter_client`
- ([#201](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/pull/201)) Parameters can now be passed to new terminals created by the `terminals` REST API.

### Changed

- ([#196](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/pull/196)) Documentation was rewritten + refactored to use pydata_sphinx_theme.
- ([#174](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/pull/174)) `ExtensionHandler` was changed to an Mixin class, i.e. `ExtensionHandlerMixin`

### Removed

- ([#194](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/pull/194)) The bundlerextension entry point was removed.

## [0.2.1] - 2020-1-10

### Added

- **pytest-plugin** for Jupyter Server.
  - Allows one to write async/await syntax in tests functions.
  - Some particularly useful fixtures include:
    - `serverapp`: a default ServerApp instance that handles setup+teardown.
    - `configurable_serverapp`: a function that returns a ServerApp instance.
    - `fetch`: an awaitable function that tests makes requests to the server API
    - `create_notebook`: a function that writes a notebook to a given temporary file path.

## [0.2.0] - 2019-12-19

### Added

- `extension` submodule ([#48](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/pull/48))
  - ExtensionApp - configurable JupyterApp-subclass for server extensions
    - Most useful for Jupyter frontends, like Notebook, JupyterLab, nteract, voila etc.
    - Launch with entrypoints
    - Configure from file or CLI
    - Add custom templates, static assets, handlers, etc.
    - Static assets are served behind a `/static/<extension_name>` endpoint.
    - Run server extensions in "standalone mode" ([#70](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/pull/70) and [#76](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/pull/76))
  - ExtensionHandler - tornado handlers for extensions.
    - Finds static assets at `/static/<extension_name>`

### Changed

- `jupyter serverextension <command>` entrypoint has been changed to `jupyter server extension <command>`.
- `toggle_jupyter_server` and `validate_jupyter_server` function no longer take a Logger object as an argument.
- Changed testing framework from nosetests to pytest ([#152](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/pull/152))
  - Depend on pytest-tornasync extension for handling tornado/asyncio eventloop
  - Depend on pytest-console-scripts for testing CLI entrypoints
- Added Github actions as a testing framework along side Travis and Azure ([#146](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/pull/146))

### Removed

- Removed the option to update `root_dir` trait in FileContentsManager and MappingKernelManager in ServerApp ([#135](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/pull/135))

### Fixed

- Synced Jupyter Server with Notebook PRs in batches (ended on 2019-09-27)
  - [Batch 1](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/pull/95)
  - [Batch 2](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/pull/97)
  - [Batch 3](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/pull/98)
  - [Batch 4](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/pull/99)
  - [Batch 5](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/pull/103)
  - [Batch 6](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/pull/104)
  - [Batch 7](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/pull/105)
  - [Batch 8](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/pull/106)

### Security

- Added a "secure_write to function for cookie/token saves ([#77](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_server/pull/77))
